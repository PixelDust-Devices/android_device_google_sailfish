# android_device_google_sailfish

This repo has the sole purpose of providing the dependencies for sailfish. The new version of our roomservice requires that a device tree exists in the PixelDust-Devices repo according to the following scheme: android_device_manufacturer_device.
In the case of sailfish, the device name cannot be marlin. Sure right? : D
